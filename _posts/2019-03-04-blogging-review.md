I said when I started writing this blog I would review the set-up before I start
the course. Well today is the last day of the precourse - I start on site
tomorrow 😲.  So...

Here's how I've been working: I've been keeping notes on different stuff I'm
working on in the drafts folder, and then I fill them out into complete posts
when I have time, and publish them. This is working pretty well. I think perhaps
I'm going into too much detail though, and I don't know if I'll have enough time
to keep it up at this level.

I've been making notes on new things I've been learning with the mentality that
writing it down will help me remember it. I don't know if this is necessarily
worthwhile though - It's quite time consuming and likely to become more so as
I get stuck into the course, and once I'm writing lots of code that will help
fix stuff in my brain in itself, so taking notes on how particular Ruby commands
behave may not seem so useful. Something to keep an eye on.

So what is the purpose of this blog then? From the Makers [blogging pill]:

> 1. **Time to reflect** Everyday you’ll be learn new tech, new practices and meet
> incredible people. It’s a lot of information, fighting for space. Get it down on
> paper, see how much you’ve learned in a day and clear your head for the next
> days work.
> 2. **Land your dream job** “Think of a challenge you’ve overcome in the
> last few months.” We’ve all had this interview question. Blogging provides a
> record of the issues you’ve faced and what you learned from them, so when you
> come to interview, you’ll have answers ready.

Those sound like good reasons! So I'll try and keep them in mind.
