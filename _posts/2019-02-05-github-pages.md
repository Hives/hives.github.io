Turns out that GitHub pages runs on Jekyll, so you can host your Jekyll site on GitHub as its own repo, and update it by pushing changes from your local repo to GitHub. So that's what I've done ðŸ™‚

It took a few tries to get it up and running, but here we are. I found [this page (help.github.com)][github-jekyll] pretty helpful.
