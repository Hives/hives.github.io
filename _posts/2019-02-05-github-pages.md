Turns out that GitHub pages runs on Jekyll, so you can host your Jekyll site on GitHub as its own repo, and update it by pushing changes from your local repo to GitHub. So that's what I've done ðŸ™‚

It works something like this:
1. Create a GitHub repo with a special name: XXXX.github.io where XXXX is whatever name you want to use
2. Set up a Jekyll site on your local machine and initialise a git repo in its root folder
3. Connect the local repo to the GitHub repo (e.g. `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/XXXX.github.io`)
4. The site should now appear at XXXX.github.io. You can edit it on your local machine, checking it using Jekyll's local server (`bundle exec jekyll serve`) and then publish changes by pushing updates from the local repo to the remote repo. (Updates take a few minutes to appear, so don't panic if they don't show up immediately)

So here's the GitHub repo for this site: <https://github.com/Hives/hives.github.io>

One tricky thing was that GitHub pages requires Jekyll use a gem called 'github-pages', which doesn't seem to be compatible with the latest version of Jekyll, so you need to specify an older version of Jekyll when setting up your site.

I found help on how to do all this using Google, this page in particular, but there are plenty of others:
