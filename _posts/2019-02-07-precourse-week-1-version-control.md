The next chunk of lessons are about version control.

## Git

An introduction to the concept of version control, and some basic git concepts
like what a repository is, the staging area, and commits.

Commands include
- `git init`
- `git add`
- `git rm`
- `git status`
- `git commit -m "Commit message"
- `git log`
- and `git checkout` to look at earlier commits.

## GitHub

Lesson 42 stressed that "as a developer, you are your GitHub profile", and that
it's the first thing potential employers will check. It recommends that Makers
students use git and GitHub for all the code we write from here on. It also says
to treat it like a CV, i.e. add a picture and your real name. So I've added my
real name now. I like my current profile pic too much to change it at the moment
though...

Then we created a new local repo and a GitHub repo, made the GitHub repo a
remote of the local repo, made a few commits and pushed them to the GitHub
remote.
