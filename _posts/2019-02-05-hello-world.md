## First post!!1

The purpose of this blog is to make notes and keep track of my progress on the
[Makers][makers] course. Students are encouraged to blog during the course to
reflect on our learning, and to keep a record of issues we've faced and what we
learned.

I've chosen to use [Jekyll][jekyll-homepage] for this because:
- It seems pretty simple to create posts - it's done offline by creating and
editing text files, so I'm thinking it should be a good way of getting down
notes quickly. I don't want to be spending time wrestling with anything that's
going to distract me from the course (famous last words? ðŸ˜•)
- Having said that... it's written in Ruby so there's the potential for some
practice installing and managing Gems if I want to add extra functionality.
- Can practice writing Markdown, which seems like fun.
- Can use Git/GitHub to manage it, more good practice
- It also means staying close to the command line, even more good practice.
- And it looks like ðŸŽ‰funðŸŽ‰, which should help me stick with it.

I guess I'll try Jekyll out over the precourse and make an assessment before the
on-site course starts to decide if it's worth continuing with, or whether I
should switch to something more straightforward like Wordpress or Medium.
