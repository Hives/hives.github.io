There were some topics in the precourse weeks 2 and 3 [learning
objectives][teachable.com] which reminded me of some stuff that was covered in
the CodeAcademy Ruby course I did to prepare for the Makers interview, but which
I realised I had forgotten. So I refreshed my memory by looking up blocks, procs
and lambdas and a couple of other topics in David Black's The Well-Grounded
Rubyist, which seems like a good resource for getting into the nitty-gritty with
Ruby.

## Blocks

A block is an anonymous function that can be passed to a method. They are
delimited by braces, `{ ... }`, or by `do ... end`. They can receive parameters
surrounded by pipes: `{ |e| some_code_here }`.

You pass a block to a method by doing something like this:

```ruby
5.times { |i| puts "I'm on iteration #{i}" }
```

We say the method **yields** to the block. You can pass a block to any
method call in Ruby, but not all of them will do anything with it ðŸ™‚. N.b. a
code block passed to a method is not an argument. It's its own thing.

It's possible to write your own methods which will yield control to a code block
by using the `yield` keyword, e.g:

```ruby
def my_method
  puts "Start of method"
  yield("John", 2)
  puts "End of method"
end

my_method { |name, age| puts "#{name} is #{age} years old" }

# outputs:
#   Start of method
#   John is 2 years old
#   End of method
```

This example calls a method and passes it a code block. When the method reaches
`yield` it yields control to the block, and passes it two parameters. When the
block has finished executing control is returned to the method.

### Block variable scope

The way blocks deal with variable scope is slightly more complicated than methods: 

#### Variables from the outer scope

Blocks share local scope with the code that precedes them. In other words, if
you define `x` before the block, and then refer or assign to `x` inside the
block, the `x` you're dealing with is the same one that existed prior to the
block, e.g.

```ruby
x = 100
1.times do
  puts x # output is 100
  x = 200
  puts x # output is 200
end
puts x # output is still 200
```

#### Block parameters (local)

However, if a block parameter is given the same name as a variable that already
exists, they will remain distinct:

```ruby
x = 100 # outer x
[1,2,3].each do |x| # block parameter is called x
  puts "Parameter x is #{x}" # 1, 2, 3
  x = x + 10
  puts "Reassigned x in block, now it's #{x}" # 11, 12, 13
end
puts "Outer x is still #{x}" # 100
```

In this case the `x` inside the block is different from the `x` outside the
block.

#### Block variables (local)

Sometimes you may want to use a variable inside a block without worrying that
you might clobber a variable in the outer scope which has the same name. You can
do this by using *reserved names*, indicated by using a semicolon to separate
names in the parameter list. The variables before the semicolon are parameters,
the variables after the semicolon are temporary variables local to the block:

```ruby
x = 100 # outer x
3.times do |i; x| # i is a parameter, x is a block-local variable
  x = i # assign to the block-local x
  puts "x in the block is now #{x}"
end
puts "x after the block ended is #{x}" # still 100 - the outer x is unchanged
```

You don't need parameters either, so this is valid: `{ |; x|
x_is_now_local_to_the_block }`

## Procs

A proc is a way of turning a code block into an object, so you can store it,
pass it around as a method argument (remember blocks can only be passed
directly, not as an argument), and call it.

You create a proc by passing a block to `Proc.new` or the `proc` method, and
call it using the `call` method:

```ruby
pr1 = Proc.new { puts "Inside a Proc's block" }
pr2 = proc { puts "Inside another Proc's block" } 
pr1.call # outputs "Inside a Proc's block"
pr2.call # outputs "Inside another Proc's block"
```

Both of these examples do the same thing (prior to Ruby 1.9 they were slightly
different...). The code block becomes the body of the proc.

Because a proc is an object, you can now use it to pass the code block to
methods as an argument:

```ruby
pr = Proc.new { puts "Inside a Proc's block" }

def my_method (a)
  a.call
end

my_method(pr) # outputs "Inside a Proc's block"
```

We saw in the previous section how you can pass a code block to a method, and
then run it from inside the method using the `yield` keyword. You can also write
a method that will take a block, and convert it into a proc to use internally,
using this `&` syntax:

```ruby
def capture_block(&block)
  block.call
end
capture_block { puts "Inside the block" } # outputs "Inside the block"
```

The `&` tells the block to take the block, do something like `Proc.new` on it,
and turn it into a proc. Quite why you would prefer to do this rather than keep
it as a block and using `yield` I'm not sure right now...

### Procs as closures

See page 427 for this:
```ruby
def call_some_proc(pr)
  a = "irrelevant 'a' in method scope"    
  puts a
  pr.call
  
end
a = "'a' to be used in Proc block"
pr = Proc.new { puts a }
pr.call
call_some_proc(pr)
```

Make notes on this...
